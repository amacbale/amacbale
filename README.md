- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam. I hold a master's degree in statistics from Portland State University and I'm looking to use it outside of academia!
- 👀 I’m interested in too many different things, like math and statistics, space, the ocean, this crazy global supply chain, the stability of free societies, entropy, gaming, and rock climbing, among other things. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and machine learning. I'm more well versed in R than in all these things, but I'm still always learning more. 
  I keep my news feeds across all the various internet fora (SO, Quora, Reddit, etc.) filled with stuff about machine learning, AI, statistics, history, cool math news, etc.  
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects pertaining to sleep, attention-span, consciousness, honestly anywhere that I can be useful and gain proficiency in data science. 
- 📫 You can reach me here @amacbale, or email me at amacbale@gmail.com
