Hi I'm Adam. I run the CADES Consulting Lab (take a look here https://sites.google.com/pdx.edu/rtg-in-cades/lab?authuser=0) at Portland State University. In 2019 I finished a MSc in Statistics at PSU, and I went on to do some private statistical consulting for a few years before coming back into the university to help launch their new NSF funded data science consulting lab. The CADES lab aims to help students grow into statistical consultants by getting exposure to real data and real clients before they graduate, while also providing both external and internal clients with solutions to their research projects, or advice to get them started. 

On a personal note, my research interests include topics in physics, complexity theory, and select topics in condensed matter physics. I'm also an avid rock climber and gamer!
